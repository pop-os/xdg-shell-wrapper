# XDG-Shell-Wrapper (WIP)

Library for arranging XDG-Shell windows in a Layer Shell window. Also supports proxying Layer Shell windows. 

XDG-Shell-Wrapper intends to support the following use cases:
- create layer shell applications with toolkits that may only support XDG-Shell
- multi-process plugin architecture

See [Cosmic Panel](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-panel) for an example of usage.
